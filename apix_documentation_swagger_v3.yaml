    # Introduction

    Welcome to the Regalii API! You can use our API documentation to access
    Regalii API endpoints, which can get you information on various billers,
    bills, and transactions.

    ---

    __Tools for Testing__

    Below is a list of tools that you can use to test different endpoints and
    their responses before you start coding against them. It is recommended that
    you test a couple of endpoints first to get an idea how to properly construct
    requests in your application.

      * [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)
      * [Postman Chrome](https://www.getpostman.com/)

    # Environments

    Separate keys for each environment and `https` protocol must be used

    - __Note:__ For security reasons, the APIx doesn't support the TLS V1.0 anymore, we recommend you to use TLS v1.2 for a better security.

    ---

    __Sandbox__

    Regalii maintains a Sandbox which allows developers to test the API using mocked data.

    ---

    __Billers__

    The list of billers is not in sync with the billers in production.

    ---

    __Credentials__

    The Sandbox accepts any credentials. You can use the following special credentials when you create a Bill to force a certain response.

    - __Note:__ Do not send real credentials to the Sandbox.

        <td>secret</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>R121</td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    Just the @{state}.ii is the required part, email and password can be anything.

    __Multi-Factor Question__

    The questions must be answered in up to 30 seconds.

    __Production__

    Once you complete your integration contact us to receive your production keys
    and endpoint.

    # Authentication

    Regalii uses an api-key and a secret-key for authentication that we generate and will provide to you.

    Regalii expects for the api-key to be included in all API requests to the server
    in the ‘Authorization’ header combined with a checksum which we will described later on:

    __Authorization:__ `APIAuth <your-api-key>:<checksum>`

    - __Note:__ You must replace <your-api-key>:<checksum> with your personal API
    key and the calculated checksum.

    ---

    __Calculating the Checksum__

    - __Note:__ All of our official libraries calculate the checksum automatically.

    __Step 1__

      A checksum string needs to be created first by using your HTTP headers containing the `Content-Type`, `Content-MD5`, `Endpoint` and today’s `Timestamp`.

      The checksum string is computed as follows:

      checksum_string = `content-type`,`content-md5`,`endpoint`,`timestamp`

      - __Note:__ The ‘Endpoint’ is simply the URL you are sending the request to. Keep in mind that
      this value has to be exactly the same as the URL you are trying to reach. For instance, if you
      want to create a new bill by requesting a post to https://apix.casiregalii.com/bills, your
      checksum string should look like this (please also notice the timestamp format).

      `application/json,,/bills,Wed, 10 Jan 2017 16:53:15 GMT`

    __Step 2__

      The checksum string is then used to create the checksum which is a Base64 SHA1 HMAC string
      encoded using your private secret key.

    __Step 3__

      For testing, verify that if you pass “application/json,,/account,Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:26:52 GMT” to your checksum function and use “verify-secret” as secret key, it should return “nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=”

      Checksum verification [example](https://gist.github.com/dagosi/c2e7db228a9c15e2f5bcdccd7a056183).

      How to create a checksum in [Bash](https://gist.github.com/dagosi/d85979e364af745750a9dff8c8c5a949)

    ---

    __How to use the Checksum__

      Now that you have a checksum, you can add it to your headers using the `Authorization` header as we previously mentioned. As an example, let’s assume that your api-key is `f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb` and that your checksum is `nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=`. Now, you can add this header to your request.

      `-H Authorization: APIAuth f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb:nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=`

      You will see that we will use this format in our Authorization header through this documentation.

        This endpoint creates a bill for billers with credentials bill identifier. When you send
        credentials to create a bill, the bill object is created and we then attempt to fetch the bill
        from the biller. Thus no matter what happens (MFA, wrong credentials, biller down, etc), the bill
        object is created. The request may take up to 59 seconds to return. If an error or MFA is
        returned, update the bill to resolve the issue.

        You may create multiple, discrete bill objects with identical credentials.

        With this endpoint you can create a new transaction by passing an RPPS Biller ID and information
        about the payment and the person (client) who is making the payment (see parameters below).

        Once the transactions are created in Regalii’s system, it takes 2-3 days to process the
        transaction. After that time, the transaction’s status will be updated. You can always check the
        transaction status by making a request to the Get transaction endpoint.

        This endpoint returns the details of a specific transaction. If the payment was successful, you
        would see the transaction status is __linked__. If there is any problem with the payment, you
        would see the __error_code__ and __error_message__ in the transaction’s response. The possible
        values for transaction’s status are `initialized`, `pending`, `linked`, `confirmed` and
        `rejected`.

        Deletes the transaction that corresponds to the `:id` sent. It’s only possible to delete a
        transaction if the processing of the transaction payment hasn’t started, i.e., if it’s still in
        the __initialized__ state. If you make a request to delete an already processing transaction,
        then you would get a __unprocessable_entity__ HTTP response.
