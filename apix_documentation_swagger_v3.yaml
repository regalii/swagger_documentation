    # Introduction

    Welcome to arcus! Here you’ll find detailed information for integrating with
    our API endpoints. We’ve tried to make this documentation as user-friendly
    and example-filled as possible, but if you have any questions, please
    [contact us](mailto:support@Regalii.com).

    Integration happens in six easy steps:

    1. Sign NDA
    2. Receive staging (sandbox) API keys
    3. Complete compliance approval
    4. Sign commercial contract
    5. Receive production API keys
    6. Get certified

    # Our products

    * __xData__ Pull real-time data from billers
    * __xPay__ Push payments (via ACH) to billers
    * __xChange__ Push card-on-file updates to billers

    ---

    # Glossary

    * __ACH__ Stands for Automated Clearing House. It is an electronic network
      for financial transactions in the United States. ACH processes large
      volumes of credit (direct deposit, payroll, vendor payments) and debit
      (consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds
      of bills) transactions in batches.
    * __api-key__ It allows arcus to uniquely identify the client making any
      requests to the APIx.
    * __secret-key__ You will be given this key to generate a unique signature
      (checksum) to your requests, thus guaranteeing their authenticity. Make
      sure never to share it.
    * __Bill__ Expenses owed by an end user to a biller which need to be paid on
      a recurring basis.
    * __Biller__ Any merchant that offers an end user a service (e.g.: Verizon,
      Uber, Time Warner)
    * __Credentials__ A set of values that gives an end user access to a
      biller's website and/or app. E.g.: username + password.
    * __MFA__ Stands for Multi-factor Authentication. Some billers require more
      than just a username/password to log in. In those situations, one or more
      MFA challenges have to be answered. An MFA challenge can be a verification
      code sent to a phone, a secret question, an image, a list of images to
      choose from, or different choices which only the end user would know the
      answer to.
    * __Migration__ It is the act of changing a bill's credit card number.

    # Environments

    arcus will provide you with separate API keys for our two existing
    environments:

    * __Sandbox__. arcus maintains a Sandbox which allows developers to test the
    API using mock data. We recommend keeping in mind the following:

        * The list of billers is not in sync with the billers in production
        * Do not send real credentials to the Sandbox

      To make requests to the sandbox environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.casiregalii.com`

    * __Production__. Once you have completed all the necessary tests on the
    sandbox, contact us to receive your production keys.

      To make requests to the production environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.regalii.com`

    ---

    # Security

    To make requests to our endpoints, you must use the `https` protocol,
    regardless of the environment you're using.

    <div class="panel panel-danger">
      <div class="panel-body">
        <h4><strong>Note:</strong> For security reasons, our API doesn't support
        the TLS V1.0 anymore; we recommend you to use TLS v1.2 for better
        security.</h4>
      </div>
    </div>

    > ## Authentication

    > arcus uses an api-key and a secret-key for authentication that we generate
    and will provide to you, one for each environment.

    > arcus expects for the api-key to be included in all API requests to the
    server in the ‘Authorization’ header, combined with a checksum which we will
    describe later on:

    > __Authorization:__ `APIAuth <your-api-key>:<checksum>`

    * ### Calculating the Checksum

        1. A checksum string needs to be created first by concatenating the
        `Content-Type`, `Content-MD5`, `Endpoint` and today's `Timestamp`:

            checksum_string = `content-type`,`content-md5`,`endpoint`,`timestamp`

              - __Note:__ The ‘Endpoint’ is simply the URL you are sending the
              request to, excluding the server and including the parameters. For
              instance, if you want to obtain a bill's data by requesting a get
              to `https://apix.casiregalii.com/bills/1`, your checksum string
              should look like this:
              `application/json,,/bills/1,Wed, 10 Jan 2017 16:53:15 GMT`
              - __Note:__ Please notice the timestamp format. In UNIX-based
              systems you could obtain it by running:
                <b>echo \`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`</b> in your terminal.

        2. The checksum string is then used to create the checksum, which is a
        Base64 SHA1 HMAC string encoded using your secret-key.

        3. For testing, verify that if you pass
        `application/json,,/account,Wed, 02 Nov 2016 17:26:52 GMT` to your
        checksum function and use `verify-secret` as secret key, it should
        return `nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=`. See checksum verification
        [example](https://gist.github.com/dagosi/c2e7db228a9c15e2f5bcdccd7a056183).

            How to create a checksum in
            [Bash](https://gist.github.com/dagosi/d85979e364af745750a9dff8c8c5a949):

            ```
            CURRENT_DATE=`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`
            CHECKSUM=$(echo -n "application/json,,/account,$CURRENT_DATE" \
              | openssl dgst -sha1 -binary -hmac "your-secret-key" \
              | base64)
            ```

    * ### How to use the Checksum

      Now that you have a checksum, you can add it to the `Authorization` header
      as we previously mentioned. As an example, let’s assume that your api-key
      is `f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb` and that your checksum is
      `nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=`. Now, you can add the following header to
      your request:

      `-H Authorization: APIAuth f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb:nLet/JEZG9CRXHScwaQ/na4vsKQ=`

    * ### Other headers

      Aside from the Authorization header, you will also have to make sure that
      your requests include the following headers:
        * __Content-MD5__ It can be blank or a hash of digest base64.

          `-H 'Content-MD5: 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg=='`
        * __Date__ It requires the same format used in the generation of the
          checksum.

          `-H 'Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2018 21:04:28 GMT'`
        * __Content-Type__ Always should be application/json

          `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
        * __Accept__ Always should be application/vnd.regalii.v3.2+json

          `-H 'Accept: application/vnd.regalii.v3.2+json'`

    # Webhooks

    arcus offers webhooks which can be used to notify you when there are updates
    to a bill or transaction.

    You can set up a webhook URL with arcus by contacting us.

    * ## Bills' Webhook
      Webhooks return the same data offered in the bill status.

      * The bill finishes updating and now requires password entry (error 420);
      waiting; or has data ready since updated
      * A long-running fetch has completed
      * The bill has been re-run by arcus due to an earlier error or outage

      __NOTE:__ It is the client's responsibility to trigger bills to refresh
      under normal operation.

    # Errors

    Responses will use standard HTTP error codes to convey basic error status
    information.

    Unless you obtain a successful response (code 200), you may encounter any of
    the following:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>400</td>
        <td>Bad Request</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>401</td>
        <td>Unauthorized -- Your API key or checksum is wrong</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>403</td>
        <td>
          Forbidden -- You are not authorized to access the resource requested

        <td>Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>422</td>
        <td>
          Unprocessable Entity -- You will receive more information on the
          response of what the problem was
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>429</td>
        <td>
          Too Many Requests -- You're sending too many requests! Slow down!

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>500</td>
        <td>
          Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again
          later.

      <tr>
        <td>503</td>
        <td>Service Unavailable -- Please try again later.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ## Unprocessable entity error codes

    Whenever you get a 422 HTTP error code, we will provide you with extra
    information so that you know what course of action to take in order to
    obtain a successful response.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Message(s) returned</th>
        <th>Recommended action</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>R120</td>
        <td>Invalid username or password</td>
        <td>Please review your credentials and try again</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
      <tr>

    # Tools for Testing

    It is recommended that you first test a couple of endpoints and get
    familiarized with their responses. This will give you an idea of how to
    properly construct requests in your application (and save you coding time).

    You can do so by using the following dynamic sections of this documentation.
    In order for the endpoints to work properly, first you have to click on the
    `Authorize` button (located before the endpoints, to the right) and enter
    your api-key and secret-key corresponding to the environment you wish to use
    (make sure that the correct environment is selected on the `Server` combo
    box located below and to the left of the `Authorize` button). Alternatively,
    you can click on the 'lock' icon located on each endpoint to enter your
    keys.

    Once you have authenticated, you can now click on each endpoint's
    `Try it out` button, which will let you enter the parameters' values (if
    any) and display a big blue `Execute` button.

    Additionally, you can use any of the following API-testing tools:

      * [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)
      * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
      * [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

    ## Handling Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

    Some billers require more than just a username/password to log in. In
    those situations, arcus will associate one or more MFA challenges with a
    bill. An MFA challenge can be a verification code sent to a phone, a
    secret question, an image, a list of images to choose from, or different
    choices which only the end user would know the answer to. When arcus
    refreshes a bill, it will be set into a status of waiting, which means
    that the end user must answer a challenge.

    ## Forcing errors and MFAs

    Within the Sandbox, we have created a merchant that will allow you to force
    a failed response as well as test the usage of MFA Challenges:
      - name: Arcus Faker
      - ID: 451cc3f4-68c4-4280-9d8a-164891bbd850

    This can be done by using a specific `login` value in those endpoints that
    create a resource for xData or xChange. If you're testing MFA challenge
    behavior, depending on which product you're using you will have to provide
    the fixed answer (see table below) on the corresponding `PATCH` endpoint:
    <b>PATCH/bills/{id}</b> for xData or <b>PATCH/migrations/{id}</b> for
    xChange.

    Following is the list of the existing `login` values for testing purposes:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Login value</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>question.the_answer</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'question' with the
          bill. Challenge answer: the_answer
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>code.the_code</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'code' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: the_code
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>image_uri</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'uri' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: arcus fi (you would be able to
          see this text if you were to convert the base64 content to an image)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>image_url</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'url' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: arcus (you would be able to see
          this text if you were to open the url provided)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>credentials</td>
        <td>
          This will return error code <b>R120</b>, HTTP status 422.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>input</td>
        <td>
          This will return error code <b>R121</b>, HTTP status 422.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>exception</td>
        <td>
          This will return error code <b>R121</b>, HTTP status 500.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>unavailable</td>
        <td>
          This will return error code <b>R122</b>, HTTP status 422.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    __Note:__ We recommend you use a different `password` everytime you create a
      resource in the sandbox.

      description: |
        This endpoint creates a bill for a specific biller.

        When you send the credentials and biller_id to create a bill, the bill
        object is created and we then attempt to fetch the bill from the biller.
        Thus no matter what happens (MFA, wrong credentials, biller down, etc),
        the bill object is created.

        Take into account that the request may take up to 59 seconds to return.

        If an error or MFA is returned, update the bill to resolve the issue.

      description: |
        This endpoint allows you to update a specific bill's credentials and/or
        answer MFA challenges.

        ## Replying to MFA Challenges

        In order to answer MFA challenges, you must provide the credentials and
        an array named 'mfa_challenges', containing one or more objects
        (depending on how many challenges the biller provided) with the
        following attributes: id, type and response. Make sure that the id and
        type match the mfa_challenge. For more detailed information refer to the
        MFA_Response Model.

        ### Bill's status changes

        * Once the challenge has been answered, arcus will be able to update the
          bill's balance. The bill's status will be set to 'updating'.
        * Once the bill balance has been updated, the bill's status will be set
          to 'updated'.
        * If the response of an mfa_challenge is incorrect OR the response is
          provided after `expires_at` time, then an error will be given and the
          bill's status will be set to 'failed'.

      summary: Creates a new transaction
      description: |
        With this endpoint you can create a new transaction by passing an xPay
        Biller ID and information about the payment and the end user who is
        making the payment (see parameters below).
        <br/><br/>
        Once the transactions are created in arcus’ system, it takes 2-3 days to
        process the transaction. After that time, the transaction’s status will
        be updated. You can always check the transaction's status by making a
        request to the `GET /transactions/{id}` endpoint.
      operationId: postTransactions
      requestBody:
        description: |
          Within the request body the required parameters to be sent are an
          `account_number`, `amount`, `currency`, `rpps_biller_id`,
          `payer_born_on`, `first_name`, `last_name` and an `address` object
          with required information for `city` and `state`.
          <br/><br/>
          You have to make sure the `account_number` matches one of the masks'
          `mask_format` of the xPay Biller.
