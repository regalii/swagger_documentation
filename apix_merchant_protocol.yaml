    # Introduction

    This documentation provides an overview of the protocol that Merchants can
    use to create an integration with Arcus in order to receive an account
    update from Arcus.

    After integration, Merchants will be able to receive updated card
    information from Arcus Issuer partners, which will reduce the possibility of
    a false positive occurring from outdated payment information and decrease
    account updating costs for the Merchant.

    # Types of Integrations With Arcus

    __Merchant Integrates with Arcus:__ Merchant can use this documentation to
    create an API integration with the Arcus infrastructure.

    __Arcus Integrates with Merchant:__ Arcus is able to integrate with existing
    Merchant API infrastructure in order to eliminate level of effort required
    to go live with Arcus xChange. To accomplish this, Arcus works with the
    Merchant to map our data to existing API endpoints for card information.
    * If interested in discussing further, please contact your Arcus
    representative to learn more.

    ---

    # Environments

    Arcus will provide Merchants with separate API keys for our two existing
    environments:

    __Sandbox:__ Arcus maintains a Sandbox which allows developers to test the
    API using mock data. We recommend keeping the following guidelines in mind:
    * The data is always going to be fake. Due to PCI requirements, testing
      environments cannot use live PCI.
    * DO NOT send any real information in the Sandbox.
    * To make requests to the sandbox environment, use the following URL:
      [https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com](https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com/health_check.txt)

    __Production:__ Once you have completed all of the necessary tests in the
    sandbox, contact us to receive your production keys.
    * To make requests to the production environment, use the following URL:
      [https://apix.arcusapi.com](https://apix.arcusapi.com/health_check.txt)

    __NOTE:__ For security reasons, it's not possible to make production
    requests through our dynamic documentation.

    # HTTPS Endpoint Requirement

    The Arcus Integration Protocol requires Merchant to create a component that
    allows a bridge to be created between Arcus and the Merchant.

    The bridge is simple, and consists of exposing an HTTPS endpoint listener
    that updates the card on file with the information sent from the Arcus API.

    ---

    # Security Overview

    To make requests to our endpoints, you must use the https protocol,
    regardless of the environment you are using.

    __Note:__ For PCI requirements, our API supports TLS v1.2 or greater.

    ---

    # Authentication Overview

    Arcus supports multiple methods of authentication, including:

    * Mutual SSL
    * Authorization Token
    * OAuth

    __Note:__ Arcus is able to adapt to any authorization methodology that our
    clients require.

    ---

    # Data Element Overview

    Below is a list of the data elements that we receive from the Issuer, and
    their corresponding uses:

    * __Migration ID:__ Migration Attempt Identifier
    * __Old PAN:__ Customer Identifier
    * __Name on Card:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __Card Brand:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __New PAN:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __Card Security Code:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __Exp Date:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __Address on File for Account:__ Place CoF at Merchant
    * __Zip Code on File for Account:__ Place CoF at Merchant

    # Order of Operations

    Arcus facilitates the transfer of new PCI from Issuer environment to
    Merchant environment.

    __Below is an overview of the Order of Operations that Arcus employs in
    order to establish a payment card in the default position for your
    service.__

    __Accompanying the Order of Operations is a Data Flow Chart.__

    __Step 1:__ Arcus receives data file for account update from Issuer.

    __Step 2:__ Arcus Sends Old PAN to Merchant in order to verify that Merchant
    has the card on file currently (Data Payload Example Below)

    ```
    {
      "id": "6ab564f9-4e9d-4b03-96d6-dd9f2c39ec53",
      "version": 1,
      "payload": {
        "type": "PAN",
        "old_pan": "5186822726831300",
       }
      }
    }
    ```
    __Step 3:__ Merchant responds with a confirmation or rejection of the
    provided PAN

    * If PAN is rejected, Arcus notifies Issuer that the card cannot be updated.

    * If PAN is confirmed, Arcus moves to Step 4

    __Step 4:__ Arcus sends Merchant data payload including all PCI and PII
    necessary to update card payment method on file (Data Payload Example Below)

    ```
    {
      "id": "6ab564f9-4e9d-4b03-96d6-dd9f2c39ec53",
      "version": 1,
      "payload": {
        "name_on_card": "John Smith",
        "card_brand": "Mastercard",
        "card_number": "0123456789012345",
        "card_security": "123",
        "card_expiration": {
          "month": 04,
          "year": 2022
        },
        "card_address": {
          "street": "214W 29th St. Suite 1007 ",
          "city": "New York",
          "state": "NY",
          "zipcode": "10001",
          "country": "US"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    __Step 5:__ Merchant updates card payment method on file.

    __Step 6:__ Merchant shares with Arcus the status of the card update

    __Step 7:__ Arcus shares with Issuer the status of account update

    # Testing with Arcus

    In order to test with Arcus, Merchants must go through the following steps:

    1. Set up the HTTPS Endpoint
    2. Share Endpoint with Arcus
    3. Provide Arcus with dummy data in order to test against
    4. Arrange a time in which Arcus will be sending test migrations to Merchant
       in order to test the ability for the Merchant to receive the migration
       files and respond with the appropriate response codes.
       a. This process is separate from setting up the appropriate Authorization
          and Encryption requirements

    # Kill Switch

    ## Inability to Access Merchant System

    Arcus has a kill switch built into the system in order to account for a
    situation in which Merchant system is unavailable for any reason.

    If Arcus attempts xxxx number of xChange Migration Requests with Merchant,
    and is unsuccessful in all migration requests, Arcus system will trigger the
    kill switch in order to prevent any further attempts.

    At that point, an Arcus representative will contact Merchant in order to
    immediately trouble-shoot the issue so that the integration may come back
    online as quickly as possible.

    __Required Remediation Timeline:__ 12 hours

    ---

    # Timeout

    ## Arcus system is not returning the expected payload

    Arcus has a timeout built into the system in order to account for the
    situation in which Arcus is not returning the expected payload response to
    Merchant.

    If Arcus attempts xxxx number of xChange Migration Requests with Merchant,
    and is unsuccessful in all migration requests, Arcus system will trigger the
    timeout in order to prevent any further attempts.

    At that point, an Arcus representative will contact Merchant in order to
    immediately trouble-shoot the issue so that the integration may come back
    online as quickly as possible.

        * Customer identity authentication method depends on Merchant
        tokenization method.
