    # Introduction

    Welcome to arcus! Here you’ll find detailed information for integrating with
    our APIx v4.0 endpoints. We’ve tried to make this documentation as
    user-friendly and example-filled as possible, but if you have any questions,
    please [contact us](mailto:support-us@arcusfi.com).

    Integration happens in six easy steps:

    1. Sign NDA
    2. Receive staging (sandbox) API keys
    3. Complete compliance approval
    4. Sign commercial contract
    5. Receive production API keys
    6. Get certified

    * __xData__ Pull real-time data from merchants (available on
      [v3.2](https://docx.regalii.com/))
    * __xPay__ Push payments (via ACH) to merchants (available on
      [v3.2](https://docx.regalii.com/))

    # Glossary

    * __ACH__ Stands for Automated Clearing House. It is an electronic network
      for financial transactions in the United States. ACH processes large
      volumes of credit (direct deposit, payroll, vendor payments) and debit
      (consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds
      of bills) transactions in batches.
    * __api-key__ It allows arcus to uniquely identify the client making any
      requests to the APIx.
    * __secret-key__ You will be given this key to generate a unique signature
      (checksum) to your requests, thus guaranteeing their authenticity. Make
      sure never to share it.
    * __Bill__ Expenses owed by an end user to a merchant which need to be paid
      on a recurring basis.
    * __Merchant__ Any merchant that offers an end user a service (e.g.:
      Verizon, Uber, Time Warner)
    * __Credentials__ A set of values that gives an end user access to a
      merchant's website and/or app. E.g.: username + password.
    * __Challenge__ Stands for Multi-factor Authentication. Some merchants
      require more than just a username/password to log in. In those situations,
      one or more MFA challenges have to be answered. An MFA challenge can be a
      verification code sent to a phone, a secret question, an image, a list of
      images to choose from, or different choices which only the end user would
      know the answer to.
    * __Migration__ It is the act of changing a bill's credit card information.
    * __Transaction__ It is the act of moving money between 2 points.

    # Environments

    arcus will provide you with separate API keys for our two existing
    environments:

    * __Sandbox__. arcus maintains a Sandbox which allows developers to test the
    API using mock data. We recommend keeping in mind the following:

        * The list of merchants is not in sync with the merchants in production
        * Do not send real credentials to the Sandbox

      To make requests to the sandbox environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com`

    * __Production__. Once you have completed all the necessary tests on the
    sandbox, contact us to receive your production keys.

      To make requests to the production environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.arcusapi.com`

      __NOTE:__ For security reasons, it's not possible to make production
      requests through our dynamic documentation.

    ---

    # Security

    To make requests to our endpoints, you must use the `https` protocol,
    regardless of the environment you're using.

        <h4>
          <strong>Note:</strong> For security reasons, our API doesn't support
          the TLS V1.0 anymore; we ask you to use TLS v1.2 for better security.

      </div>
    </div>

    > ## Authentication

    > arcus uses an api-key and a secret-key for authentication that we generate
    and will provide to you, one for each environment.

    > arcus expects for the api-key to be included in all API requests to the
    server in the ‘Authorization’ header, combined with a checksum which we will
    describe later on:

    > __Authorization:__ `APIAuth <your-api-key>:<checksum>`

    * ### Calculating the Checksum

        1. A checksum string needs to be created first by concatenating the
        `HTTP Method`, `Content-Type`, `Content-MD5`, `Endpoint` and today's `Timestamp`:

            checksum_string = `http-method`,`content-type`,`content-md5`,`endpoint`,`timestamp`

              - __Note:__ The ‘Endpoint’ is simply the URL you are sending the
              request to, excluding the server and including the parameters. For
              instance, if you want to obtain a bill's data by requesting a get
              to `https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com/bills/1`, your checksum
              string should look like this:
              `GET,application/json,,/bills/1,Wed, 10 Jan 2017 16:53:15 GMT`
              - __Note:__ Please notice the timestamp format. In UNIX-based
              systems you could obtain it by running:
                <b>echo \`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`</b> in your terminal.
              - __Note:__ Also notice that content-md5 in this case is empty
              because no body is being sent.

        2. The checksum string is then used to create the checksum, which is a
        Base64 SHA1 HMAC string encoded using your secret-key.

        3. For testing, verify that if you pass
        `GET,application/json,,/account,Mon, 02 Jul 2018 00:35:24 GMT` to your
        checksum function and use `verify-secret` as secret key, it should
        return `Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`.

            ```
            CURRENT_DATE=`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`
            CHECKSUM=$(echo -n "GET,application/json,,/account,$CURRENT_DATE" \
              | openssl dgst -sha1 -binary -hmac "your-secret-key" \
              | base64)
            ```

    * ### How to use the Checksum

      Now that you have a checksum, you can add it to the `Authorization` header
      as we previously mentioned. As an example, let’s assume that your api-key
      is `f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb` and that your checksum is
      `Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`. Now, you can add the following header to
      your request:

      `-H Authorization: APIAuth f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb:Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`

    * ### Other headers

      Aside from the Authorization header, you will also have to make sure that
      your requests include the following headers:
        * __Content-MD5__ It can be blank or a hash of digest base64.

          `-H 'Content-MD5: 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg=='`
        * __Date__ It requires the same format used in the generation of the
          checksum.

          `-H 'Date: Mon, 02 Jul 2018 00:35:24 GMT'`
        * __Content-Type__ Always should be application/json

          `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
        * __Accept__ Always should be application/vnd.regalii.v4.0+json

          `-H 'Accept: application/vnd.regalii.v4.0+json'`

    # Migration's status

    Following is a description of the statuses that a migration can be in:
      - __initialized__: the migration was just created
      - __ongoing__: migration process started
      - __waiting__: an MFA challenge needs to be answered
      - __authenticated__: the merchant has granted access
      - __successful__: the card's information was successfully updated
      - __failed__: something went wrong (more details are given in the error
        JSON object)

    ___

    # Errors

    Responses will use standard HTTP error codes to convey basic error status
    information.

    Unless you obtain a successful response (code 2XX), you may encounter any of
    the following:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>400</td>
        <td>Bad Request</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>401</td>
        <td>Unauthorized -- Your API key or checksum is wrong</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>403</td>
        <td>
          Forbidden -- You are not authorized to access the resource requested
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>404</td>
        <td>Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>405</td>
        <td>
          Method Not Allowed -- Not yet active for xData
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>422</td>
        <td>
          Unprocessable Entity -- You will receive more information on the
          response of what the problem was
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>429</td>
        <td>
          Too Many Requests -- You're sending too many requests! Slow down!
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>500</td>
        <td>
          Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again
          later.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>501</td>
        <td>
          Not Implemented -- Not configured to accept request at this time.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>503</td>
        <td>Service Unavailable -- Please try again later.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ## Unprocessable entity error codes

    Whenever you get a 422 HTTP error code, we will provide you with extra
    information so that you know what course of action to take in order to
    obtain a successful response.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>NotFound</td>
        <td>An associated resource couldn't be found (like the Merchant ID)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MissingParameters</td>
        <td>A parameter is missing from the request</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>BlankAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value is null or empty</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>InvalidAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided and its value is invalid</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>InclusionAttributeError</td>
        <td>
          A parameter is provided and its value is not included in the whitelist
          (like the US states)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GreaterThanOrEqualToAttributeError</td>
        <td>
          A parameter is provided but its value is greater or equal to the
          maximum value allowed
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>LessThanOrEqualToAttributeError</td>
        <td>
          A parameter is provided but its value is less or equal to the maximum
          value allowed
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>WrongLengthAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value length is incorrect</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    # Tools for Testing

    It is recommended that you first test a couple of endpoints and get
    familiarized with their responses. This will give you an idea of how to
    properly construct requests in your application (and save you coding time).

    You can do so by using the following dynamic sections of this documentation.
    In order for the endpoints to work properly, first you have to click on the
    `Authorize` button (located before the endpoints, to the right) and enter
    your api-key and secret-key corresponding to the environment you wish to use
    (make sure that the correct environment is selected on the `Server` combo
    box located below and to the left of the `Authorize` button). Alternatively,
    you can click on the 'lock' icon located on each endpoint to enter your
    keys.

    Once you have authenticated, you can now click on each endpoint's
    `Try it out` button, which will let you enter the parameters' values (if
    any) and display a big blue `Execute` button.

    Additionally, you can use any of the following API-testing tools:

      * [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)
      * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
      * [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

    ## Forcing errors and MFAs

    Within the Sandbox, we have created a merchant that will allow you to force
    a failed response as well as test the usage of MFA Challenges:
      - name: Arcus Faker
      - ID: 451cc3f4-68c4-4280-9d8a-164891bbd850

    This can be done by using a specific `login` value in those endpoints that
    create a resource. If you're testing MFA challenge behavior, you will have
    to provide the fixed answer (see table below) on
    <b>PATCH/challenges/{id}</b>

    Following is the list of the existing `login` values for testing purposes:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Login value</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>question.the_answer</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'question' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: the_answer
          Take into account that `the_answer` can actually be any string you
          want (e.g.: `llama`, `mr alpaca`, `Arcus Fi`, etcetera).
          Once an MFA of this kind is solved, normally it will not be necessary
          to answer it anymore on subsequent calls with the same credentials.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>code.the_code</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'code' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: the_code
          Take into account that `the_code` can be any value you want.
          An MFA of this kind will generally be asked each time you send
          credentials.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>image_uri</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'uri' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: arcus fi (you would be able to
          see this text if you were to convert the base64 content to an image)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>image_url</td>
        <td>
          This will associate a new MFA Challenge of type 'url' with the
          migration attempt. Challenge answer: arcus (you would be able to see
          this text if you were to open the url provided)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>input</td>
        <td>
          This will return an error code of <b>CreditCardDeclined</b>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>timeout</td>
        <td>
          This will return an error code of <b>TemporaryError</b>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>credentials</td>
        <td>
          This will return an error code of <b>InvalidCredentials</b>.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    __Note:__ We recommend you use a different `password` everytime you create a
      resource in the sandbox.
