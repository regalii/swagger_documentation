    # Introduction

    Welcome to arcus! Here you’ll find detailed information for integrating with
    our APIx v4.0 endpoints. We’ve tried to make this documentation as
    user-friendly and example-filled as possible, but if you have any questions,
    please [contact us](mailto:support-us@arcusfi.com).

    Integration happens in six easy steps:

    1. Sign NDA
    2. Receive staging (sandbox) API keys
    3. Complete compliance approval
    4. Sign commercial contract
    5. Receive production API keys
    6. Get certified

    # Our products

    * __xData__ Pull real-time data from merchants
    * __xPay__ Push payments (via ACH) to merchants
    * __xChange__ Push card-on-file updates to merchants

    ---

    # Glossary

    * __ACH__ Stands for Automated Clearing House. It is an electronic network
      for financial transactions in the United States. ACH processes large
      volumes of credit (direct deposit, payroll, vendor payments) and debit
      (consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other kinds
      of bills) transactions in batches.
    * __api-key__ It allows arcus to uniquely identify the client making any
      requests to the APIx.
    * __secret-key__ You will be given this key to generate a unique signature
      (checksum) to your requests, thus guaranteeing their authenticity. Make
      sure never to share it.
    * __Bill__ Expenses owed by an end user to a merchant which need to be paid on
      a recurring basis.
    * __Merchant__ Any merchant that offers an end user a service (e.g.: Verizon,
      Uber, Time Warner)
    * __Credentials__ A set of values that gives an end user access to a
      merchant's website and/or app. E.g.: username + password.
    * __Challenge__ Stands for Multi-factor Authentication. Some merchants
      require more than just a username/password to log in. In those situations,
      one or more MFA challenges have to be answered. An MFA challenge can be a
      verification code sent to a phone, a secret question, an image, a list of
      images to choose from, or different choices which only the end user would
      know the answer to.
    * __Migration__ It is the act of changing a bill's credit card number.
    * __Transaction__ It is the act of moving money between 2 points.

    # Environments

    arcus will provide you with separate API keys for our two existing
    environments:

    * __Sandbox__. arcus maintains a Sandbox which allows developers to test the
    API using mock data. We recommend keeping in mind the following:

        * The list of merchants is not in sync with the merchants in production
        * Do not send real credentials to the Sandbox

      To make requests to the sandbox environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com`

    * __Production__. Once you have completed all the necessary tests on the
    sandbox, contact us to receive your production keys.

      To make requests to the production environment, use the following URL:
        `https://apix.arcusapi.com`

    ---

    # Security

    To make requests to our endpoints, you must use the `https` protocol,
    regardless of the environment you're using.

      <div class="panel-body">
        <h4>
          <strong>Note:</strong> For security reasons, our API doesn't support
          the TLS V1.0 anymore; we ask you to use TLS v1.2 for better security.
        </h4>
      </div>
    </div>

    > ## Authentication

    > arcus uses an api-key and a secret-key for authentication that we generate
    and will provide to you, one for each environment.

    > arcus expects for the api-key to be included in all API requests to the
    server in the ‘Authorization’ header, combined with a checksum which we will
    describe later on:

    > __Authorization:__ `APIAuth <your-api-key>:<checksum>`

    * ### Calculating the Checksum

        1. A checksum string needs to be created first by concatenating the
        `HTTP Method`, `Content-Type`, `Content-MD5`, `Endpoint` and today's `Timestamp`:

            checksum_string = `http-method`,`content-type`,`content-md5`,`endpoint`,`timestamp`

              - __Note:__ The ‘Endpoint’ is simply the URL you are sending the
              request to, excluding the server and including the parameters. For
              instance, if you want to obtain a bill's data by requesting a get
              to `https://apix.staging.arcusapi.com/bills/1`, your checksum string
              should look like this:
              `GET,application/json,,/bills/1,Wed, 10 Jan 2017 16:53:15 GMT`
              - __Note:__ Please notice the timestamp format. In UNIX-based
              systems you could obtain it by running:
                <b>echo \`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`</b> in your terminal.

        2. The checksum string is then used to create the checksum, which is a
        Base64 SHA1 HMAC string encoded using your secret-key.

        3. For testing, verify that if you pass
        `GET,application/json,,/account,Mon, 02 Jul 2018 00:35:24 GMT` to your
        checksum function and use `verify-secret` as secret key, it should
        return `Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`.

            ```
            CURRENT_DATE=`date -Ru | sed 's/+0000/GMT/'`
            CHECKSUM=$(echo -n "GET,application/json,,/account,$CURRENT_DATE" \
              | openssl dgst -sha1 -binary -hmac "your-secret-key" \
              | base64)
            ```

    * ### How to use the Checksum

      Now that you have a checksum, you can add it to the `Authorization` header
      as we previously mentioned. As an example, let’s assume that your api-key
      is `f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb` and that your checksum is
      `Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`. Now, you can add the following header to
      your request:

      `-H Authorization: APIAuth f0253d2a6a76ed12499e7878d7803ffb:Rp0ZzsD2PODJHuaWoUGalIiTcrM=`

    * ### Other headers

      Aside from the Authorization header, you will also have to make sure that
      your requests include the following headers:
        * __Content-MD5__ It can be blank or a hash of digest base64.

          `-H 'Content-MD5: 1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg=='`
        * __Date__ It requires the same format used in the generation of the
          checksum.

          `-H 'Date: Mon, 02 Jul 2018 00:35:24 GMT'`
        * __Content-Type__ Always should be application/json

          `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
        * __Accept__ Always should be application/vnd.regalii.v4.0+json

          `-H 'Accept: application/vnd.regalii.v4.0+json'`

    # Tools for Testing

    It is recommended that you first test a couple of endpoints and get
    familiarized with their responses. This will give you an idea of how to
    properly construct requests in your application (and save you coding time).

    You can do so by using the following dynamic sections of this documentation.
    In order for the endpoints to work properly, first you have to click on the
    `Authorize` button (located before the endpoints, to the right) and enter
    your api-key and secret-key corresponding to the environment you wish to use
    (make sure that the correct environment is selected on the `Server` combo
    box located below and to the left of the `Authorize` button). Alternatively,
    you can click on the 'lock' icon located on each endpoint to enter your
    keys.

    Once you have authenticated, you can now click on each endpoint's
    `Try it out` button, which will let you enter the parameters' values (if
    any) and display a big blue `Execute` button.

    Additionally, you can use any of the following API-testing tools:

      * [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)
      * [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
      * [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

    # Errors

    Responses will use standard HTTP error codes to convey basic error status
    information.

    Unless you obtain a successful response (code 200), you may encounter any of
    the following:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Meaning</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>400</td>
        <td>Bad Request</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>401</td>
        <td>Unauthorized -- Your API key or checksum is wrong</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>403</td>
        <td>
          Forbidden -- You are not authorized to access the resource requested
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>404</td>
        <td>Not Found -- The specified resource could not be found</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>422</td>
        <td>
          Unprocessable Entity -- You will receive more information on the
          response of what the problem was
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>429</td>
        <td>
          Too Many Requests -- You're sending too many requests! Slow down!
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>500</td>
        <td>
          Internal Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again
          later.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>503</td>
        <td>Service Unavailable -- Please try again later.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ## Unprocessable entity error codes

    Whenever you get a 422 HTTP error code, we will provide you with extra
    information so that you know what course of action to take in order to
    obtain a successful response.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Error Code</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>NotFound</td>
        <td>An associated resource couldn't be found (like the Merchant ID)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>MissingParameters</td>
        <td>A parameter is missing from the request</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>BlankAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value is null or empty</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>InvalidAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided and its value is invalid</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>InclusionAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided and its value is not included in the whitelist (like the US states)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GreaterThanOrEqualToAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value is greater or equal to the maximum value allowed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>LessThanOrEqualToAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value is less or equal to the maximum value allowed</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>WrongLengthAttributeError</td>
        <td>A parameter is provided but its value length is incorrect</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

  #     description: |
  #       This endpoint creates a bill for a specific merchant.

  #       When you send the credentials and merchant_id to create a bill, the bill
  #       object is created and we then attempt to fetch the bill from the merchant.
  #       Thus no matter what happens (MFA, wrong credentials, merchant down, etc),
  #       the bill object is created.

  #       Take into account that the request may take up to 59 seconds to return.

  #       If an error or MFA is returned, update the bill to resolve the issue.

  #       ## Handling Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

  #       Some merchants require more than just a username/password to log in. In
  #       those situations, arcus will associate one or more MFA challenges with a
  #       bill. An MFA challenge can be a verification code sent to a phone, a
  #       secret question, an image, a list of images to choose from, or different
  #       choices which only the end user would know the answer to. When arcus
  #       refreshes a bill, it will be set into a status of waiting, which means
  #       that the end user must answer a challenge. Go to `PATCH /bills/{id}` to
  #       see how to reply to a challenge.

  #       ## For testing purposes
  #       The Sandbox accepts any credentials (we remind you never to send real
  #       credentials to it), however, you can use the following login suffixes
  #       when creating a bill to force a certain response (just the @{state}.ii
  #       is the required part; email can be anything).

  #         <table class="table table-hover">

  #       This endpoint allows you to update a specific bill's credentials and/or
  #       answer MFA challenges.

  #       ## Replying to MFA Challenges

  #       In order to answer MFA challenges, you must provide the credentials and
  #       an array named 'mfa_challenges', containing one or more objects
  #       (depending on how many challenges the merchant provided) with the
  #       following attributes: id, type and response. Make sure that the id and
  #       type match the mfa_challenge. For more detailed information refer to the
  #       MFA_Response Model.

  #       ### Bill's status changes

  #       * Once the challenge has been answered, arcus will be able to update the
  #         bill's balance. The bill's status will be set to 'updating'.
  #       * Once the bill balance has been updated, the bill's status will be set
  #         to 'updated'.
  #       * If the response of an mfa_challenge is incorrect OR the response is
  #         provided after `expires_at` time, then an error will be given and the
  #         bill's status will be set to 'failed'.

  #     description: |
  #       With this endpoint you can create a new transaction by passing an xPay
  #       Merchant ID and information about the payment and the end user who is
  #       making the payment (see parameters below).
  #       <br/><br/>
  #       Once the transactions are created in arcus’ system, it takes 2-3 days to
  #       process the transaction. After that time, the transaction’s status will
  #       be updated. You can always check the transaction's status by making a
  #       request to the `GET /transactions/{id}` endpoint.
  #     operationId: postTransactions
  #     requestBody:
  #       description: |
  #         Within the request body the required parameters to be sent are an
  #         `account_number`, `amount`, `currency`, `rpps_merchant_id`,
  #         `payer_born_on`, `first_name`, `last_name` and an `address` object
  #         with required information for `city` and `state`.
  #         <br/><br/>
  #         You have to make sure the `account_number` matches one of the masks'
  #         `mask_format` of the xPay Merchant.
